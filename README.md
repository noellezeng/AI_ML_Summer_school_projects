# AI_ML_Summer_school_projects
This repository contains the projects I've done during my summer school 2022 in AI and Machine Learning at CentraleSupelec in Paris.
All credentials of the exercices belong to CentraleSupelec teachers but the code answers are my personal input.
The my_ss_group_project file is a final group challenge we had to complete : emails' type classification 
(private competition on Kaggle, team mates: Nuno Costa and Wilmer Ansgariusson)
